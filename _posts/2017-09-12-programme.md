We have an exciting and full programme of presentations, posters and a workshop
for cmc-corpora17. The final programme, as it will appear in the proceedings
handbook, is now online.

If there are any changes or cancellations they will be communicated in our
[news](/blog) thread and during the conference itself.

For all presenters and poster authors, please do not forget to register for the
conference and CLARIN UI event at [this link](/registration) before September
25th 2017. On-site registration will be available for additional 15 EUR.
