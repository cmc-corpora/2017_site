After a very successful conference on Computer-Mediated Communication and
Social Media Corpora in Bolzano, Italy in October 2017
([cmccorpora17](https://cmc-corpora2017.eurac.edu)) we are preparing
a post-conference monograph to be published by Clermont Auvergne University
Publishing House, France in the fall of 2018 as part of their Linguistics
collection [Cahiers du Laboratoire de Recherche sur le
Langage](http://pubp.univ-bpclermont.fr/public/Linguistique.php){:target="_blank"}.
An open-access version will also be made available.

We invite unpublished original work focusing on the collection, analysis
and processing of computer-mediated communication, such as exchanges on social
media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), forum posts, news comments, wiki discussions
and blog entries as well as e-mail, SMS, WhatsApp, YouTube and discussions in
multimodal environments. Authors who did not present at the conference are also
welcome.
