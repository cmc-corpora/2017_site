### How to use TEI for the annotation of CMC and social media resources: a practical introduction

The goal of the event is to give a practical introduction into the annotation of language data
from genres of computer-mediated communication (CMC) and social media using TEI. In an
introductory section participants will learn about the general architecture of TEI encoding
schemas and about rules for the creation of so-called customizations which
allow for extending the use of TEI with textual genres and in domains which are
not yet covered by the current version of the TEI guidelines. Examples for TEI
customizations are the representation schemas for CMC/social media genres
developed in the TEI special interest group "computer-mediated communication".

In a hands-on session, participants will learn how to use these customizations to create a
basic TEI representation for their own CMC/social media data. For this purpose participants
may bring samples from their own data/corpora or select a sample from collections of
Wikipedia talk pages in several languages prepared by the instructors. Format specifications
for participantsâ€™ own data will be announced in advance.
For the hands-on session, participants will be asked to bring a laptop computer with WLAN
and a full or trial license of the oXygen XML editor.
