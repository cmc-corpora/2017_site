#### Cancelled Talk

Unfortunately, the talk "Reliable Part-of-Speech Tagging of Low-frequency Phenomena in the Social Media" by Tobias Horsmann, Michael Beißwenger and Torsten Zesch had to be cancelled (Day 1, 15:00-15:30).

The "Book Launch" (Day 2, 08:45-09:00) was moved into this spot, i.e. Day 2 will start at 9:00.
