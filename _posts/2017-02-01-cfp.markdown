The 5th conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities will be
held in Bolzano/Bozen, Italy on 3-4 October 2017 and will focus on the
collection, analysis and processing of mono and multimodal, synchronous and
asynchronous communications. The focus will encompass different CMC genres.
These include, but are not limited to, discussion forums, blogs, newsgroups,
emails, SMS and WhatsApp, text chats, wiki discussions, social network
exchanges (such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin), discussions in multimodal
and/or 3D environments (virtual worlds, gaming worlds). 

The conference will bring together researchers who are interested in the
collection, organization, processing, analysis and sharing of CMC data for
research purposes. We invite submissions on corpus analysis of various types of
CMC data for linguistic or applied linguistic purposes and Natural Language
Processing.
